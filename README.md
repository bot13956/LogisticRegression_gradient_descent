# LogisticRegression_gradient_descent

This code applies the Logistic Regression classification algorithm to the iris data set.
The weights used for computing the activation function are optimized by minimizing the log-likelihood cost function
using the gradient-descent method. 

For more information about the logistic regression classifier and the log-likelihood cost function, see the following
book: "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka (Chapter 3)
  
This code is a modification of the Adaptive Linear Neuron (Adaline) code provided in the above-mentioned book.
